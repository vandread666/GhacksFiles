<b>&quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot;<br>
<br>
</b>To have it show:<b><br>
<br>
</b>With the external drive plugged in, right click the drive in the folders 
list, then left click Properties and Hardware. Left Click the name of the 
external drive in this list, then click Properties and Policies. This takes you 
to the &quot;Write caching and safe removal page&quot;. The default position in my XP is 
&quot;Optimize for quick removal&quot; not &quot;Optimize for performance&quot; as implied by 
Freecom and Microsoft. You can put the icon in the notification area by clicking 
the underlined &quot;Safely Remove Hardware&quot; on this page.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Donald Orme.<b><br>
<br>
</b>To remove it:<b><br>
<br>
</b>If you have an USB device attached to your system, you will notice an icon 
in the Notification area, which - when clicked -<br>
&nbsp;will give you the option to 
Stop your hardware, before you unplug it. <br>
<br>
It is possible that you never unplug this hardware. So how do you get rid of the 
icon? Right-click the notification area, and selecting Properties. Under the 
Notification area heading, click Customize. Find the Safely Remove Hardware icon 
and select Always hide in the Behavior column next to it (press OK and Apply to 
back out). </font></p>

Note:&nbsp; System Restore option in Windows XP<br>
<br>
Users of Windows XP should temporarily turn off System Restore. Windows XP uses 
this feature, which is enabled by default, to restore the files on your computer 
in case they become damaged. If a virus, worm, or Trojan infects a computer, 
System Restore may back up the virus, worm, or Trojan on the computer.<br>
<br>
Windows prevents outside programs, including antivirus programs, from modifying 
System Restore. Therefore, antivirus programs or tools cannot remove threats in 
the System Restore folder. As a result, System Restore has the potential of 
restoring an infected file onto your computer, even after you have cleaned the 
infected files from all the other locations.<br>
<br>
Also, a virus scan may detect a threat in the System Restore folder even though 
you have removed the threat.<br>
<br>
For instructions on how to turn off System Restore: <br>

<p align="left"><b>Save Settings on Exit</b></p>
<p align="left">Normally when Windows exits it saves the desktop configuration, 
including icon location, appearance etc. This setting disables these changes 
from being saved, this is useful in both a secure environment. <br>
<br>
Go to Start/Run/Regedit and navigate to this key:<br>
<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br>
Create a new DWORD value, or modify the existing value called 'NoSaveSettings' 
set the value to equal '0'. <br>
Exit your registry, you may need to restart for the changes to take effect. <br>
<br>
Or you can apply this registry edit from my site:<br>

To use the Regedit: Save the REG File to your hard disk. Double click it and 
answer yes to the import prompt. REG files can be viewed in Notepad by right 
clicking on the file and selecting Edit.<br>

probably all other AGFA scanners using the FotoLook software package. This

HOW TO: Modify Scheduled Tasks in Windows XP</a><br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140223144420/http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q311119">Task 
Scheduler Does Not Run Tasks When &quot;Run As&quot; User Account Has No Password</a></p>
<p align="left"><b>Scheduled Tasks- AutoRun</b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Q.</b>&nbsp; What is the secret to getting tasks to run when 
no one is logged on when using Windows XP? <br>
<br>
-schedule service is running, set to automatic, log on as 'local system' <br>
-task is scheduled to run under an user account which is an administrator <br>
-task is scheduled to run under an user account with a password <br>
-task itself is legit as it will run when executed directly <br>
-task schedule setup is valid as it will run IF I remain logged on <br>
-Event log shows nothing <br>
-task log shows no attempt to run the task <br>
-task status is 0x0, but that is irrelevant since 'time last run' reveals it was 
not run at all<br>
<br>
Since schedule runs as a service with startup set to automatic and logon set to 
'local system', one would <br>
assume that schedule service begins running when the computer is started, 
regardless of whether or not anyone <br>
logs on. Since the task is set up to run with an administrator logon complete 
with password, one would assume that since the schedule service is running, at 
the scheduled time it would logon as the designated user and run the task.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left"><b>A.</b>&nbsp; You need to replace the Task Scheduler Log File 
which can be accomplished quite easily. If you follow these <br>
exact instructions, the shedlgu.txt file will be replaced with a brand new one 
without any information other than <br>
system start-up information upon the first boot. Click Start&gt;Click Run&gt; and type 
msconfig&gt; click Selective <br>
Startup and uncheck the Load System Services check box. Click OK and wait for 
the hour glass to stop. Restart <br>
the computer, click OK to the first Window that indicates that you have selected 
&quot;Selective Startup&quot;. </p>
<p align="left">When the System Configuration Utility reappears, Check the 
Normal Startup Box. Click Start&gt; Click Search&gt; Click All Files and Folders 
Category and type schedlgu.txt and Enter. Windows will search and locate the 
schedlgu.txt file. Press Stop<br>
as
soon as the file is located. Right click on the file schedlgu.txt and delete and 
send to the recycle bin. Now restart the computer again by selecting Start&gt;Turn 
Off Computer and Select Restart. </p>
<p align="left">You will now have a new Task Scheduler Log File. You may check 
the new Log File and the one start up entry that I described by selecting Run 
and typing the file name schedlgu.txt and click OK. Appearing will be your new 
Task Scheduler Log.</p>

Windows� XP has a known issue for not finding a number of File Types when you do 
a Search for Files &quot;containing text&quot; or using the &quot;A word or phrase in the file&quot; 
option. This can be remedied for many file types, but not all. <br>
<br>
Download the VBS file below. Double click the file you just saved. You'll be 
prompted to enter a file extension. If the PersistentHandler value is correct, 
no changes will be made. If the PersistentHandler value exists, but is 
different, no changes will be made. If no PersistentHandler value exists, then 
it will be created. <br>
<br>
Enable XP's Search to find text in files:<br>

http://www.dougknox.com/xp/scripts/xp_persisthandler.vbs</a><br>
<br>
Manual Edit:<br>
<br>
To resolve this problem for other file types, install a program that registers a 
filter for the file type that you want to search. If no program that provides a 
filter is available, you can use the plain text filter for a file type. <br>
<br>
Go to Start/Run/Regedit and add a PersistentHandler key under the file type key 
in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and set its (Default) string value name to the following 
value: {5e941d80-bf96-11cd-b579-08002b30bfeb} <br>
<br>
For example, to use the text filter provider for .pas files, the following 
registry setting should exist: <br>
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.zzz\PersistentHandler\(Default) = 
{5e941d80-bf96-11cd-b579-08002b30bfeb}<br>
<br>
After you add this value to the registry, you must log off and then log back on 
to make the change take effect.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Tip: </b>&nbsp;Windows XP keeps a record of all 
files on the hard disk so when you do a search on the hard drive it is faster.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There is a downside to this and because the computer has to index all files, it 
will slow down normal file commands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
like open, close, etc. If you do not do a whole lot of searches on your hard 
drive then I suggest turning this feature<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
off:&nbsp; Open My Computer/Right click your hard drive/properties. Uncheck 
&quot;Allow indexing service to index this disk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
for faster searches&quot;. Apply to all folders and subfolders.</font></p>

<br>
Go to the key listed below:<br>

S-1-5-21-1960408961-220523388-682003330-1003<br>
<br>
With the S-1-5-21....in blue, choose File/Export and save it to your deskop and 
name it (ex). googlehistoryclear.reg. Leave the registry open then go to your 
desktop.<br>
<br>
Right click the saved reg file and choose Edit. If it needs an association 
choose Notepad.<br>
<br>
Scroll down to these keys: <br>
<br>
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Protected Storage System<br>
Provider\S-1-5-21-839522115-1708537768-1343024091-1003\Data\e161255a-37c3-11d2-bcaa-00c04fd929db\e161255a-37c3-11d2-bcaa-00c04fd929db\q:StringData]<br>

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Protected Storage System<br>
Provider\S-1-5-21-839522115-1708537768-1343024091-1003\Data\e161255a-37c3-11d2-bcaa-00c04fd929db\e161255a-37c3-11d2-bcaa-00c04fd929db\q:StringIndex]<br>
<br>
To make the search/scroll easier they are listed in alphabetic order and you are 
looking for the end of the string in this case \q:StringData and \q:StringIndex. 
So scroll down to the q's....<br>
<br>
Under q:StringData<br>
Highlight what is listed after the word &quot;Behavior&quot;= only up to the words &quot;Item 
Data&quot;= and delete it. Then place a - (minus sign) after the = so that it looks 
like this: &quot;Behavior&quot;=-<br>
<br>
From there hightlight what is listed after the words &quot;Item Data&quot;= only up to the 
next key and delete it. Then place a - (minus sign) after the = so that it looks 
like this:<br>
&quot;Item Data&quot;=-<br>
<br>
Do the same for q:StringIndex.<br>
<br>
Once done choose File/Save. Use the red X to close. If it asked to save again, 
answer yes. <br>
<br>
Return to the registy and delete this key: (right click, delete, accept the 
warning)<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Protected Storage System Provider\<br>
S-1-5-21-1960408961-220523388-682003330-1003<br>
<br>
Then go back to your desktop and double click your saved regedit, answer yes. 
Then open Google and the search history is gone.<br>
<br>
To Clear Google Toolbar History<br>
<br>
Click on the Google logo to access the drop down menu. Choose the Clear Search 
History option. This will clear all the previous searches out of the drop down 
box. <br>
<br>
<b>TIP: </b>&nbsp;If you prefer several search engines:<br>
<br>
Create an empty subfolder called &quot;Search Engines&quot; under your Windows folder, and 
change the value of the Registry key above to read (replace %windir% with your 
real Windows folder name):&nbsp; %windir%\\Search Engines<br>
<br>
From now on, when you click that Search button, this empty folder will open in 
the Search pane.&nbsp; All the hard work is done, we just need to fill it with 
Search engines. For this go to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140223144420/http://www.allonesearch.com/">
http://www.allonesearch.com/</a>. Start by dragging this URL from the Address 
bar into the Search pane. A link to this web page will be created in the Search 
pane. <br>
<br>
Browse through the list of Search engines there, and simply drag the URLs of the 
ones you like into the Search pane. You can rename them, customize the folder's 
appearance, delete them by right-clicking, change their icons, and generally do 
all the drag-and-drop natural Windows GUI things to them that you wish.<br>
<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> The only thing that doesn't work well is using subfolders (they 
don't behave nicely), however you can work around this by using a modified 
internet shortcut (via Notepad), to point to a folder instead (it will open in 
the main window), if you want to create a hierarchy of specialized Search 
engines.<br>
<br>
Go to Start/Run/Regedit and navigate to this key:<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main<br>
<br>
Create a new String value, or modify the existing value, called &quot;Search Bar&quot; and 
set it to the Search URL of your choice under value data. <br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> This tweak can also be applied on a per-user basis under the [HKEY_CURRENT_USER] 
hive. <br>
<br>
Exit your registry, you may need to restart or log out of Windows for the change 
to take effect. <br>
<br>
<b>Note2:</b> If you want a choice of several Search engines, create an empty 
subfolder called &quot;Search Engines&quot; under your Windows folder, and change the 
value of the Registry key above to read (replace %windir% with your real Windows 
folder name): %windir%\\Search Engines<br>
<br>
Fill the folder with Search Engines of your choice. When you click that Search 
button, this folder will open in the Search pane.<br>

<b>Searching Help and Support - Disable the Search Word from 
Being Highlighted in Blue</b></p>
<p align="left">When searching for a topic in the Help And Support Center, the 
search feature automatically highlights the word you searched for every time it 
occurs in the help topic text. This can be obnoxious. For example, when we 
searched for the word �Registry� and then displayed the Windows Registry help 
topic, the word Registry occurred twelve times in the text, and each time was 
highlighted in blue. To turn this off, click Start, Help And Support, and Set 
Search Options. Under Set Search Options, click the Turn On Search Highlight 
checkbox to deactivate that feature.<br>
<br>
While you�re still using Set Search Options, notice the line that reads, Return 
Up To 15 Results Per Provider. This means that of all possible search results, 
up to 15 results will appear from each of three categories: suggested topics, 
full-text search matches, and the Microsoft Knowledge Base. To display more or 
fewer results for each search, highlight the number 15 and type the number of 
maximum results you want to see.</p>

<p align="left">Fix bug in IE 6.0 sendmail.dll file (Functionality of 
Menu/Send/Link by Email)<br>
<br>
In IE6 when trying to Send/File/Link by Email from the menu bar, IE6 prevents 
the loaded Web Address from being copied into the email message area of either 
OE6 or Outlook XP. This does not occur in IE 5.5. This is specifically regarding 
the IE feature, which allows the convenient quick paste of the Web Address into 
an email message area without having to manually copy and paste. (This does not 
address OE or Outlook security blocking of misc. attachments.)<br>
<br>
To fix this, a copy of IE 5.5 sendmail.dll file is required, located in the 
Windows/System folder. Delete or rename and/or backup the IE 6.0 sendmail.dll 
file, which is located in the Window/System32 folder (Windows XP). Paste the IE 
5.5 sendmail.dll into the Windows/System32 folder. This will allow you to use 
the Menu/Send/Link by Email function on the IE 6.0 menu bar. </p>

<p align="left"><b>Services - Here is a way to figure out which services to set 
as Automatic and which to set as manual or disabled.</b></p>
<p align="left">Step1:&nbsp; Set ALL your services to *manual* setting.<br>
Step2:&nbsp; Reboot computer and wait for windows XP to load. XP will boot 
pretty slowly, since it has to turn on each service<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; separately. 
Use your computer for a bit, doing what you normally do during a computing 
session. This will allow any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other 
services to activate (such as DHCP or other services that didn't load during the 
boot process).<br>
Step3:&nbsp; Go back to the list of services, and see which ones are Started. 
Change the services that are marked as Started, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Automatic*. This 
way windows will automatically load all of the services that you normally use, 
and the ones that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't use 
will stay unloaded.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Tip:&nbsp; </b>Since Win2K, it has been possible to hit 
Shift-F10 during setup to get a console window.&nbsp; This can be great to see what's 
hanging up an install or look up info left in a text file, but it has obvious 
limited usefulness - it's too darned<br>
hard to do some operations from a console window!<br>
<br>
What you can do, however, is use &quot;Winfile&quot; from the very moment that setup 
starts.&nbsp; It needs to be the NT version - either NT 4 or 3.51 will work, and 
presumably earlier versions also.&nbsp; The WfW3.11 or Win9x version *will not* work<br>
on 2000/XP.<br>
<br>
Since Winfile is only 244 K, it can be carried around comfortably on a tech 
floppy or burned onto a tools CD.&nbsp; Not an everyday need, but when you do need 
file browse ability during an XP setup, you really need it.</p>

<p align="left"><b>How to verify XP software you bought is OEM/UPGRADE/RETAIL?<br>
</b><br>
I am sure we all have noticed Microsoft product marketing strategy. Whenever 
they launch any new product line, there are various flavors of it available 
right from day one. Some are given adjectives like UPGRADE version or FULL, 
others RETAIL v/s OEM and then of-course we have various categories of the 
product like HOME, PRO , SERVER , ADVANCED SERVER etc etc. </p>
<p align="left">Well ever wondered what you bought is same as what was 
advertised ? How to tell the difference. Here comes the help. Look for a file 
called <b>Setupp.ini</b> that is present on your Windows XP CD and double click 
on it and browse its content. There is a field called PID=. This PID is what 
would tell us exactly what we have got.First 5 bytes of PID decide whether (it 
is OEM or RETAIL or is an UPGRADE ) and last three digits determine what kind of 
CD KEY will it accept. Here are some of the typical PID values:<br>
<br>
Retail = 51882 335<br>
Volume License = 51883 270<br>
OEM = 82503 OEM</p>

Delete this key {59031a47-3f72-44a7-89c5-5595fe6b30ee}. The Shared Documents 
folders (which are normally under the group called &quot;Other Files Stored on This 
Computer&quot;) will be gone. </p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="4"><a name="sdsp3"></a>Shared Documents - After 
SP3</font></b></p>
<p align="left">How to share the &quot;Shared Documents&quot; folder in the LAN on a 
system<br>
running Windows XP Professional with SP3 installed<br>
<br>
1) Generic:<br>
<br>
The following guide works fine running Windows XP Pro with SP3 installed.<br>
<br>
Since there are no experiences in working with Windows XP Home,<br>
it might be possible not to get the expected results with WXP Home.<br>
<br>
Also there is a registry hint that might avoid to set (or create)<br>
some registry keys or values if running WinXP Home (more about this later).<br>
<br>
This guide has been written, because applying service pack 3 leads to<br>
several security hints due to sharing folders within a workgroup.<br>
<br>
Since there are many changes to be made in the registry, it is very<br>
strongly suggested to backup the registry very first. A faulty edited<br>
registry leads to an unstable or even unbootable system. Please note,<br>
that every change you perform in the registry editor is stored immediately.<br>
<br>
If you've decided to share folders in a system running WXP pro SP3 over the LAN,<br>
please disconnect your system from the LAN by unplugging the network cable<br>
from the computer to avoid severe security problems (more later).<br>
<br>
As far as this guide has been written to share the &quot;Shared Documents&quot; folder,<br>
it also applies to the generic sharing problem in WXP-SP3. Therefore you've only<br>
to skip the section of moving the &quot;Shared Documents&quot; folder and you've only<br>
to carry out the other steps.<br>
<br>
Finally: Good luck !<br>
<br>
2) Prepare:<br>
* decide which folders you want to share with others over the LAN<br>
* Back up your system<br>
* Unplug your network cable<br>
* Log in as &quot;admistrator&quot; or any other user with administrative privileges.<br>
* Back up the registry<br>
<br>
3) Relocate the &quot;Shared Documents&quot; folder (if any):<br>
* copy the whole folder into the new location.<br>
<br>
Using the MS tool &quot;robocopy&quot; you're able to copy the ACL's too.<br>

<br>
* Follow the steps described on this Kelly's Korner site:<br>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140223144420/http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_shell_folders.htm">
http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_shell_folders.htm</a><br>
<br>
Please note, that you must apply the registry settings to the <br>
&quot;HKLM\Software\Microsoft\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders&quot; key rather<br>
than to the &quot;HKCU\Software\Microsoft\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders&quot;<br>
key if moving the &quot;Shared Documents&quot; folder.<br>
<br>
As mentioned in Kelly's article you may use the tweakui powertoy for XP<br>
for changing the registry values properly.

<br>
* Re-logon<br>
<br>
4) Grant permissions:<br>
* Unauthorize the &quot;Guest&quot; account. This is the reason why we disconnected our 
system from the LAN.<br>
Without unauthorizing the &quot;Guest&quot; account you can't get access to the system 
from another computer.<br>
Unauthorization means, that the &quot;Guest&quot; account needs no password. <br>
<br>
It will be done by changing the following value in the registry:<br>
<br>
- Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa<br>
- Change (or add) the DWORD value: ForceGuest=0<br>
<br>
* Close the registry editor and disable the &quot;Guest&quot; account (if not already 
done)<br>
<br>
* Right click the folders you're about to share, share it and remove the &quot;Guest&quot;<br>
account (aka &quot;Everybody&quot;) in both the &quot;Sharing-&gt;Permissions&quot; and the &quot;Security&quot; 
Tab.<br>
<br>
* Grant permissions to anybody you want to share the specified folder in both 
the<br>
&quot;Sharing-&gt;Permissions&quot; and the &quot;Security&quot; Tab. Ashure the users in the workgroup<br>
having a local account.<br>
<br>
5) Finalize:<br>
* Reboot your system<br>
* Connect your system to the LAN (plug in network cable)<br>
* Try to connect from a foreign system using a valid account, all should work 
fine.<br>
* Try to connect from a foreign system using the &quot;Guest&quot; account, access should 
be denied.<br>
* I know that it's awesome, but back up your system and registry again :-)<br>

</b><br>
When you click Start to display Windows XP's new Start menu, you'll see a list 
of six most-frequently-used programs on the left side of the menu (below 
Internet and Email). Want to squeeze a couple more in there?<br>
<br>
Right click the Start button (or a blank area of the Start menu) and select 
Properties. On the Start Menu tab, click the Customize button next to Start 
Menu. Under Programs, use the up and down arrows to adjust the number of 
programs in the list--the max is 30, although you'll only be able to see up to 
eight with the default large icon size--then click OK twice.</p>

<p><b>Have You seen those annoying searches for broken shortcuts/links?&nbsp;
</b></p>
<p>Well there is are couple of ways to solve this problem. If You are 
comfortable with Registry manipulation, Open registry editor by going to 
Start/Run/Regedit and navigate to this key:<br>
<br>
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
Add a new key by the name &quot;NoResolveTrack&quot; (without quotes) and sets its value 
to 1.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by group policy editor as well. Open group policy editor 
by opening START-RUN and entering gpedit.msc. Navigate to User Configuration\AdministrativeTemplates\Start 
Menu and Taskbar group policy and selecting &quot;Do not use the tracking-based 
method when resolving shell shortcuts&quot;.&nbsp; <br>

<p align="left">This is a very noted problem for users after installing SP1. I

options, the dial out process is independent to this<br>
option. You will notice that the interface for dialing out is different than the 
standard IE interface.<br>
<br>
For DSL:&nbsp; Disable TCP/IP for the DSL network card, since it only serves as 
a virtual modem for the DSL connection. If you have a LAN connected to your PC 
be careful not to deactivate TCP/IP for the local area network: If you have DSL 
and LAN you should have two network cards in your PC, one is for the DSL, the 
other for the LAN, so make sure you deactivate TCP/IP for the right card (the 
DSL card, for example &quot;LAN Connection 1&quot; or &quot;LAN connection 2&quot;).<br>
and follow the instructions.<br>

The &quot;rasapi32.dll&quot; file is located in the &quot;c:\windows\system32&quot; folder by 
default. If this file is also located in the &quot;c:\windows&quot; folder and this file 
is an old version, similar issues will occur. Check if &quot;rasapi32.dll&quot; file is 
only located in the &quot;c:\windows\system32&quot; folder. If not, rename other 
&quot;rasapi32.dll&quot; files to the &quot;rasapi32.old&quot; files. Reboot the computer<br>
and check if this issue still occurs. If this issue still occurs, try the 
following method to overwrite the current &quot;rasapi32.dll&quot; file:<br>
<br>
1. Insert into the Windows XP CD (I assume that the drive letter of CD-ROM is 
E).<br>
2. Click the Start Menu and choose the &quot;Run�&quot; menu. Input the command:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expand e:\i386\rasapi32.dl_ c:\windows\system32\rasapi32.dll<br>
3. Restart the computer and check if this issue still occurs.<br>
<br>
Method 2:=========<br>
<br>
1. From Start, go to Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then press Enter.<br>
2. Make a backup copy of the following registry key:<br>

3. Delete the following value:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Telephony\Cards\NexxtID

you'll <br>
be sure that you get the correct installation files if Windows needs any.&nbsp;

<b>SP1 - Internet Explorer (Can't view websites that use JavaScript) by Weston 
Wheat<br>
<br>
Problem:</b> After installing ServicePack1(SP1) for Win XP pro and Explorer 6.0 
SP1, the browser with not open web pages that were link by a JavaScript. A good 
example was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140223144420/http://www.tvguide.com">www.tvguide.com</a>&nbsp; go to the 
listing web and try to open the information window for a show. The child window 
will not open and the browser would return a error icon in the bottom bar.<br>
<br>
After playing with the security settings and even try to reinstalling Microsoft 
Java Virtual Machine for Win XP, still the browser still would not respond to 
JavaScript links.<b><br>
<br>
The Fix:</b> Out of desperation, I un-installed the SP1 for Win XP Pro by going 
to the Control Panel, Add/Remove programs window. And selected Service Pack 1 
for XP to be un-installed. Followed the on screens instructions and rebooted the 
computer with ask to. <br>
<br>
Still, however the browser would not respond to JavaScript links. So again, out 
of desperation I un-installed Explorer 6.0 by going to the Control Panel, 
Add/Remove programs window, Click on Add/Remove Windows Components and 
de-selected Explorer. Click next and followed the on screen instructions until 
finished. The Explorer icon was still there on the desk-top after running the 
un-install for Explorer. <br>
<br>
So I rebooted the computer and upon reboot the icon was missing. Now, I wanted 
to re-install Win XP SP1 for all the security updates, I was considering running 
without the service pack, but change my mind when I saw how many security issues 
there were to install without the service pack.<b> </b>I ran the downloadable 
executable file version of the service pack (130 megs file size).<br>
<br>
Followed the on screen instructions. Note: Always use the backup old files 
option. And rebooted when I was ask to do so. Next, came the re-install of 
Explorer 6.0 . I went to the Control Panel, Add/Remove programs window, click on 
Add/Remove Windows Components and selected Explorer. Clicked next and followed 
the on screen instructions. Rebooted at the end of the process. <br>
<br>
When the computer come up, I opened Explorer and check the reversion level and 
it was at SP1. I know, weird!, but I decided to test the browser and it worked 
on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140223144420/http://www.tvguide.com">www.tvguide.com</a> page. All was then 
well. My browser now works great and it does seem a little faster.<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b> I think by running the executable file version of the service 
pack to install the SP1 for Win XP Pro and not the express method as I had the 
first time when the problem began, it replaced the problem dll's/files. Then by 
installing Explorer on top of XP Pro SP1, the browser had a good footing.<br>
<br>
<b>The short of it is: </b>Un-installed XP SP1. Un-installed MS Explorer 6.0. 
Then re-installed XP SP1 and finally re-installed MS Explorer 6.0. I hope this 
helps someone.<b>&nbsp; Weston Wheat</b></p>

<p align="left">Some users claim to have lost the option of having Outlook 
Express open with all of the folders expanded (or at least<br>
the ones that were expanded when Outlook Express was last closed). </p>
<p align="left">Workaround attempted:&nbsp; Extract these OE files from 
pre-SP1files from $NTServicePackUninstall:&nbsp; - msimn.exe and<br>
- msoe.dll.&nbsp; However, XP actually goes and auto-replaces them with the SP1 
versions seconds after the copy.</p>
<p align="left">Workaround solution:&nbsp; Create a folder called \pre-sp1 under 
\Program Files\Outlook Express, copy those 2 pre-SP1 files in there, and execute 
this old version of msimn.exe to get OE running back the way it was before 
installing SP1.<b><br>

<p align="left">When you attempt to log on to Recovery Console in Windows XP by 
typing the correct password for the local Administrator account, Recovery 
Console may display the following error message:<br>

The password is not valid. Please retype the password. Type the Administrator 
password: This error message may occur even though you typed the correct 
password. If you start Windows XP, successfully log on by using the same 
password, change<br>
the local administrator's password, and restart the computer to Recovery 
Console, you receive the same error message.<br>
<br>
<b>Reason:</b>&nbsp; If you have the Recovery Console installed on disk, you 
have to re-install it using the SP1 version as it is not up dated by the 
application of SP1. If you are booting up the PC with the original non-SP1 CD 
then you are not using the SP1 version of the Recovery Console and you will have 
to create your own slipstreamed SP1 XP CD.&nbsp; <br>

try to remove Windows XP SP1 by using the Add/Remove Programs tool, you may 
receive an error message that states that Windows XP SP1 has already been 
removed.<br>
<br>
When you perform an in-place upgrade of Windows XP, you reinstall Windows to the 
same folder. When you do this, files that were installed by SP1 for Windows XP 
are overwritten by the original version of the files from the Windows XP CD-ROM. 
This also occurs when you run a repair or upgrade from Windows XP Home Edition 
to Windows XP Professional Edition. For this reason, you must reinstall the 
service pack.</p>

<b>SP1 - System Restore (Highlights of System Restore fixes included in SP1)<br>

</b>1. Fix for SR not launching due to the framedyn.dll error you all have been 
reporting.<br>
<br>
2. No calendar available in the SR wizard to select restore points due to the 
the .htc file association being knocked out in the<br>
registry has been fixed.<br>
<br>
3. A fix for SR failing restores. A lot of you were seeing failed restores when 
restoring to any restore point. Although some of<br>
it was attributed to SR data store corruption, in most cases it was possibly due 
to locked file issues causing the restore<br>
process to fail, especially in scenarios where fast user switching was used. 
This was a known issue which is now fixed in in<br>
SP1. <br>
<br>
This will hopefully resolve all cases for failed restores and it would be great 
if all of you running into this problem could<br>
upgrade to SP1 and provide us feedback on this issue, whether it has resolved 
the problem for you or not. <br>
<br>
4. Fix for drive table inconsistency on a machine causing SR to not create 
restore points.<br>
<br>
5. Security fixes for SR to keep away those terrible hackers and viruses.<br>
<br>
So upgrade to SP1 and provide us with some feedback on your issues with SR and 
whether they are now resolved, especially when dealing with failed restores.<br>

<p align="left"><i><b><font size="4"><a name="cleanup"></a>Cleaning Up after 
Installing SP2 - MVP Alex Nichol</font></b></i></p>
<p align="left">Installing SP2 leaves a lot of space on hard disk taken up by 
files you would only ever need if you were to uninstall it. Once you are sure 
you are happy with it: <br>
<br>
A very big restore point will have been made. Once a new regular size one has 
been made in the ordinary way, clean up by going to <br>
Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup <br>
and in 'More Options' click the bottom button to remove all but the most recent 
restore point. <br>
<br>
Delete the hidden folder of files that would be restored by an Uninstall:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140223144420/file:///C:/Windows/$NTServicePackUninstall">
<span style="text-decoration: none"><font color="#000000">
C:\Windows\$NTServicePackUninstall</font></span></a> <br>
Once done, if you try to use the 'Remove' for Service pack 2 in Add/remove 
programs, that will fail and offer to remove itself. <br>
<br>
<b><i>Note:&nbsp; </i></b>To view the hidden folder - Go to: Windows 
Explorer/Tools/Folder Options/View/Show Hidden File and Uncheck Hide Protected
<br>
Operating System Files.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Note2:&nbsp; </b></i>Alternatively (for the $NtServicePackUninstall$ 
folder):&nbsp; <b>Notes by MVP Torgeir Bakken</b><br>
<br>
If you make a backup of the folder to e.g. a CD, you can put it back if you need 
to uninstall SP2. After restoring the backup,<br>
run %windir%\$NtServicePackUninstall$\spuninst\spuninst.exe to start the 
process.</p>
<p align="left"><b><i>Note3:&nbsp; </i></b>If you see&nbsp; %windir%\$NTUninstall* 
folders which dates back to your SP1 installation, you can delete those. They 
are not removed by the<br>
SP2 installation in case you want/need to go back to SP1 (and then be able to 
uninstall the hotfixes in case you need to).<br>
<br>
The following folders should be safe to delete:<br>
<br>
%windir%\$xpsp1hfm$\<br>
%windir%\$NtUninstallQ&lt;some#&gt;$\<br>
%windir%\$NtUninstallKB&lt;some#&gt;$\</p>
<p align="left"><b>Note4:</b>&nbsp; Stop and start System Restore to possibly 
regain some space (but you will lose your current Restore points). You also may 
want to reduce<br>

There may also be a large folder C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download 
depending on how you did the installation. That can also be deleted. <br>
<br>
Check that the installations temporary folder did get properly removed - it will 
be on the drive where you downloaded the setup files, so probably <br>
C: and have a long name of random letters. If it is still around, delete it. And 
burn the downloaded file to a CD so as to have it if you ever need to reinstall.
<br>
<br>
There will also be a large folder C:\Windows\ServicePackFiles. Do <b>not</b> 
delete this - it will be used in future by Windows File Protection - but on an 
NTFS <br>
disk you can compress it to save about 200MB of disk space. R-click on it, 
Properties, click the Advanced button, and select 'Compress'.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Added info:&nbsp; Can Hotfixes be removed via Add or 
Remove?&nbsp; MVP Ronnie Vernon<br>
</b></i><br>
Some of the Hotfixes (Mostly security updates) do not have an uninstall feature, 
these will not appear in the Add and Remove list. If a Hotfix does appear <br>
in the Add and Remove list then it can be uninstalled just like any other 
program. <br>
<br>
If you uninstall the Hotfix, you will lose the benefits of that patch. This 
should only be done if you can determine that you are experiencing negative 
effects <br>
from the particular Hotfix.<br>
<br>
If you simply do not want them to appear in the Add and Remove list and you are 
sure that you will not need the uninstall option, you can remove items <br>
from that list by using a registry tweak.<br>

Manual Edit: Go to Start/Run/Regedit and navigate to this key:<br>

Make sure that you back up each Key before deleting it. <br>

Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy</a></b> detects and removes spyware, a relatively new 
kind of threat not yet covered by common anti-virus applications. Spyware 
silently tracks your surfing behavior to create a marketing profile for you that 
is transmitted without your knowledge to the compilers and sold to advertising 
companies. If you see new toolbars in your Internet Explorer that you haven't 
intentionally installed, if your browser crashes inexplicably, or if your home 
page has been &quot;hijacked&quot; (or changed without your knowledge), your computer is 
most probably infected with spyware. Even if you don't see the symptoms, your 
computer may be infected, because more and more spyware is emerging. Spybot-S&amp;D 
is free, so there's no harm giving it a try to see if something has invaded your 
computer.</p>

TO: Prevent a Program from Being Displayed in the Most Frequently Used Programs 
List in Windows XP </a><br>
<br>
<b>Start Menu - Add Shortcuts To Start Menu<br>
</b><br>
When you click Start to display Windows XP's new Start menu, you'll see a list 
of six most-frequently-used programs on the left side of the menu (below 
Internet and Email). Want to squeeze a couple more in there?<br>
<br>
Right click the Start button (or a blank area of the Start menu) and select 
Properties. On the Start Menu tab, click the Customize button next to Start 
Menu. Under Programs, use the up and down arrows to adjust the number of 
programs in the list--the max is 30, although you'll only be able to see up to 
eight with the default large icon size--then click OK twice.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Tip:&nbsp; </b>Windows XP can only 
display up to eight most-often-used programs on the left side of the new Start 
menu. If you'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
like to see more at a time (up to 14), decrease the size of the icons displayed 
there.&nbsp; Right click the Start button (or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 
blank area of the Start menu) and select Properties. On the Start Menu tab, 
click the Customize button next to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Start Menu. On the General tab, select Small icons, then click OK twice.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Start Menu - Add/Remove Items On Right Side Of Start Menu </b></p>
<p align="left">When you open the Windows XP Start menu, you notice a shaded row 
of options on its right side--My Documents, My Pictures, My Music, Favorites and 
so on. See anything there that you don't need or want? Remove it. While you're 
at it, you can change certain links (without arrows to expand them) into pop-out 
menus, or vice versa.<br>
<br>
Right-click the Start button or a blank area of the Start menu and select 
Properties. On the Start Menu tab, next to 'Start menu,' click the Customize 
button. Click the Advanced tab and you'll see certain items selected under Start 
menu items. To remove an item from the Start menu, de-select it or choose its 
'Don't display this item' option.<br>
<br>
To display a commonly-used item, such as the Control Panel or My Documents 
folder, as a pop-out menu, select 'Display as menu' below that item. When you're 
through making changes, click OK.</p>
<p align="left">
<b>Start Menu - Clean</b></p>
<p align="left">
At the top there are links to the Internet and E-mail programs; these default to 
the Microsoft programs. Under those two shortcuts, we find the &quot;Most frequently 
used&quot; programs list. But when you start using other programs, you'll notice that 
Microsoft has given its own an apparent &quot;head start&quot;, as they will be slow to 
disappear from the list. </p>
<p align="left">
It is, however, easy enough to remove a program from this list: just right-click 
on the program you want to remove, and from the menu select Remove from This 
List. When you right-click, you might also note that Pin to Start menu is an 
option. When you select that option, the shortcut will be moved to the top of 
the Start menu, directly below the E-mail link. </p>
<p align="left">
You can also remove a program that was pinned to the Start menu by 
right-clicking, and choosing Unpin from Start menu (which will restore it to its 
position on the lower part of the start menu), or choosing Remove from This 
List, which will remove it completely from the Start menu. </p>
<p align="left">
Next you will notice a great number of links on the right side of the Start menu 
such as My Documents, My Recent Documents, My Pictures and My Music. <br>
<br>
Well, I don't know about you, but that's nothing that I need there! Just 
right-click an empty space on the Start menu, click Properties, click Customize 
and select the Advanced tab. <br>
<br>
Now you can customize the look &amp; feel of your Start menu in whatever way you 
want! There are a number of items (Control Panel, My Computer, My Documents, My 
Music, and My Pictures) for which you have these three options: <br>
<br>
Display as link <br>
Display as menu <br>
Don't display this item <br>
<br>
It is especially useful to have the Control Panel as menu, as this will create 
faster access to the individual Control Panel applets. One other option that 
deserves mention is the Highlight newly installed programs. This is another 
annoyance you will want to switch off quickly! Not only will newly installed 
programs be listed with a yellowish highlight in the All Programs menu, you will 
also receive a pop-up when you open the start menu that tells you New programs 
installed. </p>
<p align="left">
On the General tab (after pressing Customize on the Taskbar and Start Menu 
properties), you can also change the Internet &amp; E-mail programs listed on the 
Start menu. The drop-down boxes should contain all programs installed on your 
system. <br>
<br>
Also you can change the number of shortcuts listed on the (left side) Start 
menu, as well as clear the whole list of programs in one shot. On the Taskbar 
and Start Menu properties itself, you can also choose Classic Start menu. 
Choosing this option will make your start menu look like the Windows 2000 Start 
menu. </p>

<b>Start Menu Scrolling - Enable</b></p>
<p align="left">When there are more items on the Start Menu than can fit on the

scrolling menu. This tweak controls that functionality. <br>

modify the existing value, called 'StartMenuScrollPrograms' and edit the value 
according to the settings below. Exit your registry, you may need to restart or 
log out of Windows for the change to take effect. <br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b> This can be used either on a user by user basis by adding it to 
HKEY_CURRENT_USER or on a computer wide basis by adding it to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

But I haven't found a way to make an URL clickable either on the General Tab nor

one, go to Windows Explorer\Windows\System32. In the right pane scroll down to

<br>
A temporary fix to address this issue is to make the user copy the framedyn.dll 
file from \Windows\System32\WBEM directory to the \Windows\System32 directory. 
We are currently working to determine why this is occurring, one possible case 
is due to windows path corruption.</p>

<b>System Settings - Edit Hidden System Settings using Group 
Policy Editor<br>
</b><br>
Windows XP has a great program called Group Policy Editor that allows system 
administrators to modify the settings to a great number of windows features. TO 
start the program up follow the directions below. <br>
<br>
1. Open the start menu and click Run<br>
2. Type gpedit.msc<br>
3. The Group Policy MMC appears<br>
4. Click through the different nodes of the tree to see all the hidden features 
of Windows XP that you can edit without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; touching the registry.<br>
<br>
Examples: Changing IE displays, Clearing the pagefile at shutdown, boot-time 
defrag settings, and many many more.&nbsp; <br>
Another tip is to add this to your Administrative Tools by adding the shortcut 
to gpedit.msc</p>
