during boot and allow you to optimise your boot up. A very handy tool.<br>
<br>
Download Bootvis:

<br>
This is a self extracting ZIP file. Double click the file you just downloaded 
and unzip it to the folder of your choice. Locate Bootvis.exe click on it. You 
will now see the GUI of bootvis.<br>
<br>
Now go to File/New and choose &quot;Next boot trace&quot; or &quot;Next boot and drivers 
chase&quot;. Leave everything else as is and get ready for a reboot in 15 seconds.
<br>
<br>
Then click on the Bootvis.exe, it will now output the results, once it has 
finished generating the report, you will see graphs 5 <br>
or 6 graphs. They look a 
bit confusing at this stage.<br>
<br>
From the main menu .. Click on Trace &gt;&gt; optimize system, then reboot. <br>
<br>
You will see a message box &quot;Please wait for bootvis to load&quot; ... about 20 
seconds later another message box will appear &quot;Optimizing system for boot 
performance&quot; basically bootvis is rearranging the boot files for a faster 
startup<br>

&quot;Every File Format in the World&quot; </a></b><br>
<br>
This is a list of file name extension or suffixes that indicate the format or 
usage of a file and a brief description of that <br>
format. We don't really show the 
file format itself here. In fact, many formats are proprietary and we couldn't 
show <br>
them to you. In some cases, we link to a definition of the file format or 
to related information. <br>
<br>
In general, if you have the program that uses the file format, that program can 
be used to open or otherwise use the file. <br>
Some file formats (for example, the

  <li>Make an additional copy of SFC_OS.DLL called SFC_OS1.DLL and open it in a

<b>Files - Rename</b></p>
<p align="left">
How to Rename Multiple Files with Windows Explorer. Start Windows Explorer. To 
do so, click Start, point to All <br>
Programs, point to Accessories, and then click 
Windows Explorer. Select multiple files in a folder. To do so, press and <br>
hold 
down the CTRL key while you are clicking files. After you select the files, 
press F2. Type the new name, and then <br>
press ENTER. <br>
<br>
<b>NOTE:</b> When you complete the preceding steps, the highlighted state of all 
files except one disappears, so it may appear <br>
as
if you are only renaming one 
file. However, after you press ENTER, all of the files are renamed. When you 
rename multiple files, all of the renamed files have the same name with a number 
in parentheses appended to the name to make <br>
the new file name unique. For 
example, if you type BUDGET as the new name, the first file is named BUDGET. All 
of <br>
the remaining selected files are named BUDGET( x ), where x is a unique 
number, starting with (1). </p>

<b>Floppy Drive - Please insert disk<br>
<br>
</b>This behavior can occur if a folder that includes a .pif file that 
references a program file on a floppy disk drive is opened. <br>
For example, if you 
have a .pif file with a command line &quot;a:\edit.com&quot; in the Windows\Temp folder, 
your floppy disk <br>
drive may be active when you start your computer. <br>
<br>
To resolve this issue, change the command line reference in the Properties of 
the shortcut, or delete the shortcut: For example, if the command line reads a:\edit.com, 
change the line to read edit.com.<br>
<br>
This issue most often occurs after the contents of a floppy disk are copied to a 
folder on your hard disk. This can also <br>
occur if a shortcut on your hard disk 
references a program that is on a floppy disk. Note that this can also occur on 
<br>
other removable media. <br>

Music, My Pictures, Shared Documents, etc) has lost <br>
its name, lost its icon, or 
has the wrong Task Pane template, how can I get it back? </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This problem can occur if the hidden <em>desktop.ini</em> 
file in the special folder is corrupt or missing. Here are the <br>
steps to fix this 
problem: <br>
<br>
Open the special folder, then in the address bar type <em>\desktop.ini</em> at 
the end of the path and press enter. This will open Notepad. <br>
<br>
If, instead of opening Notepad, you get a message saying Windows cannot find the 
file right click in the folder and select properties, then go to the Customize 
tab and click Change Icon then click OK and click OK again. This will create a
<em>desktop.ini</em> with the correct Hidden and System attributes. Now you can 
repeat the first step.<br>
&nbsp;<ol>

When you try to use options in Windows Explorer to apply the view setting of the

This behavior can occur if more than one instance (copy) of Windows Explorer is

<p align="left">How to Format Windows XP -&nbsp; MVP Michael Stevens</p>
<p align="left">If you want to format for a clean install, simply boot from the 
XP CD (you will need to set the bios order to boot from the <br>
CD) and when it 
finishes it's scan for previous Windows installations choose the XP partition 
you want to format and setup <br>
will delete, format and do a clean install.<br>
<br>
If you want the remove XP to reinstall a previous OS, you can use a Windows 
98/Me startup disk to format the partition if <br>
it is Fat 32, or use fdisk to 
delete the non-dos partition if it is NTFS. Note that you can only use fdisk to 
delete primary <br>
NTFS partitions.<br>
<br>
Obtain a Win 98/Me startup disk here. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140102151933/http://www.bootdisk.com">

NTFS partition, you can download the image file to <br>
create a

<b>Frequently Used Programs</b></p>
<p align="left">If FUP are not being listed:&nbsp; Check the number of programs 
to be listed: Right click the Start button/Properties/Customize/Number of 
Programs...</p>
<p align="left">The number is also listed here:&nbsp; Start/Run/Regedit</p>
<p align="left">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced. 
In the right pane, <br>
check the Value Data under Start_MinMFU.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Tip:</b>&nbsp; To prevent a program from being 
displayed in the Most Frequently Used Programs list: <br>
<br>
1. Start Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).<br>
2. Add an empty string value named NoStartPage to the following registry key, 
where &lt;Program name.exe&gt; is the name <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of the executable file that is used to start the program:&nbsp; HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\&lt;Program name.exe&gt;<br>
3. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.</p>
<p>This setting allows you to decide which programs may be shown in the most 
frequently used programs list on the Windows Start menu.&nbsp; Start/Run/Regedit 
and navigate to:&nbsp; HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications</p>
<p>To stop a specific application appearing on the MFU program list open its 
sub-key and create a new empty string value called &quot;NoStartPage&quot;.&nbsp; To allow 
an application to be shown in the list delete the &quot;NoStartPage&quot; value. Restart 
Windows <br>
for the change to take effect. </p>
